Q1 (3 points): Write a C# program that:
- takes as input a number N, if the number N is a prime number, print “N is prime”, else print “N is non-prime”.

Use break keyword to stop the loop


Q2 (2 points): Write a C# program:
- input an integer N
- and it prints on screen the following square pattern, where the number of
rows and columns is equal to N
- e.g. for N=5, the following pattern should be printed on screen:


Hint: nested for loop



Q3(5 points):  Write a C# program 
- input an integer number N
- and it prints on screen the following square pattern, where the number of
rows is equal to N
- e.g. for N=5, the following pattern should be printed on screen:

Hint: nested for loop, compare the row and column values with if statement.




Bonus (5 points):  Write a C# program
- input a number N
- and it prints on screen the following square pattern, where the number of
rows is equal to N
- e.g. for N=5, the following pattern should be printed on screen:
